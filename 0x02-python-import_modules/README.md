# 0x02. Python - import & modules

## Introduction
This project, part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum, focuses on Python's import and module functionalities. It explores how to import functions from other files, create modules, and handle script executions in Python. The set of tasks is designed to provide practical experience in organizing and structuring Python code effectively using modules and imports.

## Environment
- **Python Version**: 3.8.5
- **Style Guideline**: Pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- **Development and Testing Environment**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Setup
To begin working on these tasks, clone the ALX higher level programming repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alx-higher_level_programming
```

## Usage
Each task is encapsulated in a standalone Python script. To execute a script, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
./script_name.py
```
## Requirements
- All Python files must be executable.
- Python files should begin with '#!/usr/bin/python3' shebang line.
- Code should conform to Pycodestyle version 2.8.*.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, participants should be able to explain, without external assistance:

- The benefits and applications of Python programming.
- How to import and utilize functions from other Python files.
- The process of creating and using Python modules.
- How to employ Python's built-in dir() function.
- Techniques to prevent scripts from executing during import.
- Methods for handling command line arguments in Python programs.
