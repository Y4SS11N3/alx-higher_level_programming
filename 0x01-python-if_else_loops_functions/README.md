# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

## Introduction
This collection of Python tasks is part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum and focuses on introducing the Python control structures, including if/else statements, loops, and functions. The tasks are designed to provide a practical understanding of these essential programming constructs, highlighting their usage and implementation in Python.

## Environment
- Python Version: 3.8.5
- Style Guideline: Pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- Development and testing environment: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Setup
To get started with these tasks, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Y4SS11N3/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions
```

## Usage
Each task is a standalone Python script. To execute a script, use:

```bash
./script_name.py
```

## Requirements
- Adherence to Pycodestyle for Python code formatting.
- All Python files must be executable.
- Python files should begin with '#!/usr/bin/python3' shebang line.

## Project Files
This set includes various Python scripts, each tailored to demonstrate and test specific aspects of Python programming, particularly if/else statements, loops, and function usage.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand and apply if/else conditional statements in Python.
- Utilize for and while loops, and grasp their distinction from similar constructs in languages like C.
- Implement functions, understand variable scope, and explore the concept of return values.
- Familiarize with Python's arithmetic operators and error traceback.
