# 0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

## Introduction
This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum, focusing on Python's advanced data structures like sets and dictionaries. The tasks involve understanding and implementing various operations on these data structures, including list comprehensions, mapping, and lambda functions.

## Environment
- **Language**: Python
- **Version**: Python 3.8.5
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Style Guideline**: Pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)

## Setup
To get started with these tasks, clone the ALX Higher Level Programming repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Y4SS11N3/alx-higher_level_programming/
```

## Usage
Each task in this project is contained in a separate Python script. The scripts can be executed as follows:

```bash
./<script_name.py>
```

## Requirements
- All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.5).
- Each file is executable and begins with `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- All files end with a new line.
- Code uses the Pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) for checking.
- No modules are imported in the files.
- The length of files is tested using `wc`.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand and utilize Python sets and dictionaries.
- Learn to manipulate data structures effectively.
- Apply advanced Python data structures to solve complex problems.
- Develop a deep understanding of mutable and immutable objects in Python.
